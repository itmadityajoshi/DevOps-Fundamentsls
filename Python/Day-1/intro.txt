#Print

To print something in python, we can put the value that we want Python to print.

    Print("Hello World!")

we want to print a string value that's why we used "" to wrap the Phrase.




# What is Expected Output?

learners and organization use test cases to confirm that their code produces the desired output.

Test cases excess the program's performances by comparing the actual output with the expected result.
If the output match, the test case is marked as "Success"; otherwise, it is marked as "Fail", indicating a discrepancy.

For instances, printing "hello" insted of "Hello" would fail the test.


# Numbers

Variables are the reference name given to a value in your code. Basically you gave a name to a value using variables.

For instances,
 a = 20

ptyhon have two types of Numbers values:-
 1. int - all the numbers without decimals
 2. float- all the numbers, with decimals, 3.3 or -1.04

Note: we don't need to tell python about what types of data you are storing.


# string

Variables with sring value.

String value is the combination of one or more characters written between single or double quoatation mark.

Single quoatation mark
 a = 'Learne Deutsch'

Double quoatation mark
 d = "Learne Deutsch"

To display just types
print(a) &
print(b)

# Boolean

Boolean is a simply either True or False.

These value are used to give a decision in conditional statements.
storing a Boolean value in a variables is no different than numbers and strings.

You can use or store Boolean values like this,
 a = True
 or,
 a = False

There is only two Boolean value i.e True or False.
